## PA_1:  Closest pair of points
* Implemented the algorithm that returns the closest pair of points in a Euclidean two-dimensional plane.
* Implemented Simple algorithm using Brute-force algorithm.
* Implemented Improved algorithm using divide-and-conquer method. 
* Compare/Contrast the two algorithm performances (time complexity) by analyzing the number of calls of the algorithm. 

## PA_2 : The Maryland Lighthouse Challenge
* Implemented the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that finds the fastest tour covering all the lighthouses.
* Implemented Simple algorithm using Brute-force algorithm.
* Implemented the improved algorithm using the Nearest Neighbor method and Multi-Fragment Heuristic method. 
* Analyze the algorithm performance (time complexity) by measuring the number of calls of the algorithm. 

## PA_3: Interleaving Strings
* Analyze the dynamic programming algorithm that finds if a string is interleaved of two other strings.
* Improved the interleaving algorithm that handles leading noise and matching repetitions.
